Reliability Aware VNF Embedding with Partial Protection
This is the GitHub repository for the thesis "Reliability Aware VNF Embedding with Partial Protection." In this thesis, we present a new approach to virtual network function (VNF) embedding that takes into account the reliability of the underlying physical infrastructure. Our approach uses a heuristic algorithm that incorporates partial protection mechanisms to enhance the availabilty of the VNFs.
